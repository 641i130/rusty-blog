# rusty-blog

This was/is written for me to practice Rust. I also just wanted a fast, lightweight, safe way to start blogging, without any PHP bloat `\s`. I plan to start writting some more higher-level blog posts on things I do for fun... I do a bit too many projects too, so maybe that'll be interesting to read through.

# General usage:
- Have a folder full of random markdown files
- Throw the folder in this webserver structure; it'll automatically convert the MD files to HTML and structure it into an HTML list page, by creation date of the files

# Dev notes:
Actix has a cool logging system... I plan to incorporate useragent/ip fingerprinting counting or something of the like. Maybe some built in filtering if thats possible... Not too sure yet.
